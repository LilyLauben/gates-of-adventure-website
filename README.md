# Inspiration

## The Concept:

![alt text](https://www.trillygames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Logo_NewGold.png "Gates of Adventure Logo")

This website is a product site for the fantasy action card game that my team has been developing for 2 years. Currently, the game is in late stages of development, and we are doing public demos and playtests, gearing up for a Kickstarter in January. 

The site needs to have a landing page with the pitch for the game, pages for the game's story and core rules, space to hold an art gallery, playtest announcements and schedules, and prominent links to our other social media.


## Landing Page

- Game Logo on a top banner across the page.

![alt text](https://www.trillygames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Logo_NewGold.png "Gates of Adventure Logo")
- Company logo in corner (To be created)
- A detailed and eye-catching piece of cover art beneath that. (To be created)
- A small and exciting pitch for the game.

```
Gates of Adventure is a cooperative fantasy choose-your-own-adventure board game that's all about taking down  increasingly tough enemies and bosses by strategizing with your friends to pull off with spectacular combos. Fight your way to the bottom of the mystery of what happened to the mining town of Bald Rock!
```
- Links to other pages where more information about rules, story, and events can be found.

## Adventure Page
- A small piece of art, of smoke rising over the mountain (to be created)
- A blurb that is the intro to the story

```
The road has led you to Bellowhill, a small village at the crossroads of two of the largest trade roads. Further down the road is Bald Rock Mine. The entire village is in an uproar. No one has heard from Bald Rock in weeks. The smiths are especially irate, as they’ve run through their supply of ore, and the shipment expected last week never arrived. The elders whisper about seeing smoke over the hills… where the mining town sits.

You and your party have been charged with investigating the happenings of Bald Rock.
```

## Playing the Game Page
- A description of how the game plays, accompanied by pictures of cards

```
Play as one of 6 heroes in an adventuring party to investigate the strange disturbances at Bald Rock Mine.  Be a Rage Dancer who slashes apart foes and turns their own strikes back against them, a Masked Minstrel who instills allies with courage while striking fear into enemies, a Dragon Priest of creation and destruction, or any of several other totally unique heroes! 

During the game, you’ll work with your allies to take down a gauntlet of foes through a branching series of encounters.  Use your hand of ability cards to attack enemies, attach buffs to allies and debuffs to enemies, or heal your friends. Enemies will counter with their own unique passive abilities and attacks, so be prepared. In between fights, you’ll discover what’s happening to the town of Bald Rock as you build out your kit with new ability cards, gain glory points for going above and beyond, trade glory for treasure cards, and ascend to greater heights of power!

What awaits at Bald Rock for you, Heroes?
```


## Team Page
- A company logo (To be created)
- A short description of the company

```
Hive Frog studio is a student company from Philadelphia, PA. We're in our last (or second-to-last) years of college, and when we're not doing homework or struggling through midterms, you can find us sitting around a table, playing Dungeons & Dragons, which was the start of this whole adventure.
```
- Pictures of each team member (can be found [here](https://www.trillygames.com/our-team/))
- A bio, written by each team member (can be found [in the same place](https://www.trillygames.com/our-team/))
- A description of the groups that our team is part of

```
Our team is indebted to the following groups:

Philadelphia Game Makers Guild:
Our game wouldn't be the same without the montly playtests at the Philly GMG, and all of your generous feedback. Nor would our game have nearly the same publicity without your coordination and mentorship, because we would never have been able to attend events like Pax Unplugged or Keystone Comic Con.

Entrepreneurial Game Studio:
Many thanks to the Drexel EGS for your game nights, guidance and constant motivation to keep working. You pushed us to be better, and our game might still be using whiteboard markers if not for your help!

Entrepreneurial Law Clinic:
Law is hard, and we would never have had the confidence to tackle our LLC foundation and Operating Agreement writing without your aid!
