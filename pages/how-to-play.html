            <p>Play as one of 4 heroes in an adventuring party to investigate the strange disturbances at Bald Rock Mine.</p>

                    <h2>Audrin, the Rage Dancer</h2>
                    <p>Audrin's playstyle focuses around taking as many hits as they can sustain. Each hit Audrin takes empowers their attacks via their passive ability, Pain Reservoir, which causes all of their attacks to deal additional damage.</p>

                <div class="fourGridContent">
                    <img src="../images/RinPortrait.jpg">
                    <h2>Rin, the Sworn Protector</h2>
                    <p>Rin's passive ability, Shield Up/Spear Out, oscillates between a defensive buff and an offensive buff. Similarly, her abilities are split between defensive abilties focused on defending herself and her friends and offensive abilities, which tend to be very reliable, but not highly damaging.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fourGridContent">
                    <img src="../images/DaruPortrait.jpg">
                    <h2>Daru, the Dragon Priest</h2>
                    <p>Daru is a prophet of Tiamat, the Great Dragon of creation and destruction. This duality in Tiamat's domain causes Daru's abilties to be cleanly split between healing and damaging, or even both simultaneously.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fourGridContent">
                    <img src="../images/LydiaPortrait.jpg">
                    <h2>Lydia, the Masked Minstrel</h2>
                    <p>Lydia's abilities are all about embodying the spirit of legendary heroes, starting with the focus of her passive ability, the Mask. The Mask can be moved rapidly between her allies, and her enemies, emboldening her allies to strike true or filling her enemies with fear.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>During the game, you’ll work with your allies to take down a gauntlet of foes through a branching series of encounters.  Use your hand of ability cards to attack enemies, attach buffs to allies and debuffs to enemies, or heal your friends. Enemies will counter with their own unique passive abilities and attacks, so be prepared.</p>
            <p>In between fights, you’ll discover what’s happening to the town of Bald Rock as you build out your kit with new ability cards, gain glory points for going above and beyond, trade glory for treasure cards, and ascend to greater heights of power! What awaits at Bald Rock for you, Heroes?</p>
