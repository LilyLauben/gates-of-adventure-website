                    <h2>Allison, the Kerfuffle Goddess</h2>
                    <p>Hai, I’m Allison, and I’m the one always on fire. When I’m not behind a notebook or backstage…I can probably be found listening to Fall Out Boy or Panic! At The Disco. My favorite color is purple, my favorite fruit is ALL THE RED GRAPES, and my favorite play is Death Trap. My role on the team is the Business (Kerfuffle) and Social Media Manager, and play-testing. If you’re reading this, it’s probably because I posted it.</p>

                    <h2>Jill, the Pusher of Buttons</h2>
                    <p>Hiyya! My name is Jill, and if I’m not on my couch under five fluffy blankets binging the latest TV series, I’m in the basement working on my next film. My role is creating the fun vids that come along with the game. My favorite color is… oh god I like all of them… putting me on the spot here… just not yellow. My favorite fruit is strawberry, and my (current) favorite TV show is Game of Thrones. If you’re seeing a moving picture, I was probably behind the camera.</p>

                    <h2>Justin, the One Who Breaks Things</h2>
                    <p>Heyo, I’m Justin. While I tend to spend most of my time staring at my computer screen, in a dark room, while screaming to my computer and breaking my computer, I still spend a decent amount of time in a dark theatre as well as screaming to the theatre. My favorite colors are Red and Black. My favoite fruit is an orange. My favorite integer is – CARL, YOU ARE NOT AN INTEGER! STOP ACTING LIKE ONE!! My role on this team is mostly undoing all the work the Design Czar did to make the game fair. If something goes right, I probably broke it before you.</p>

                    <h2>Lily, the Ert</h2>
                    <p>Hullo, I’m Lily. I discovered a very long time ago that what I loved most was to use art to take interesting and cool ideas and bring them into this world. Like dragons. As I grew up and became a real human adult, I wanted to see if I could make this my actual adult job, so I continued to draw things. Especially dragons. My favorite color is all of them, really, but especially green, and my favorite fruit is actually all of them. I like a lot of things. As far as my role on this team, if you’re looking at it with your eyeballs, it’s probably something I made.</p>

                    <p>Hey, I’m Trenton and I’m the Design Czar of the company. I come from a clan of snake people that will one day rise up and destroy Western society. My favorite color is teal, my favorite philosopher is Judith Butler, and my favorite fruit is jicama. Along with Lily, I largely design the heroes, enemies, abilities, and treasure you’ll find in the game. If something about how the game plays goes wrong, it’s probably my fault.</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Rory! My role in the team is the Finance, Research, and Crafting Tentacle. My primary lair is beneath a fluffy blanket. My favorite color is blue, my favorite fabric is fleece, and my favorite fruit is kiwi. If it’s not directly part of the card game, I probably had my tentacle in it.</p>

                    <p>Sup, I’m Tori. I’ve gone from playtester and cheerleader to Layout Artist and Associate Tentacle. When I’m not crying over illustrator or fabric, I’m in my bed watching Netflix or YouTube. My favorite color is Pantone 2039c, and my favorite fruit is strawberries, and my favorite animal is a white tiger. If you’re playing with cards, I probably screamed at them in Adobe.</p>
